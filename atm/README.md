# ATM

This Python code represents a simple command-line ATM simulation. It allows users to create accounts, log in, check balances, deposit, withdraw, and send money to other account holders. User data is loaded from and saved to a CSV file, and accounts are created with randomly generated card numbers and PINs. The code presents a text-based menu for interacting with the ATM system, making it a basic demonstration of ATM functionality.
